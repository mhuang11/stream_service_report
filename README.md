# Streaming Services Report
This project utilizes the `ggplot2` package to explore and visualize a dataset scraped from the website [reelgood.com](https://reelgood.com/) on movies streamed on four big platforms (Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+), which is automatically loaded into the variable `streaming` in the RMarkdown file.

The dataset was scraped by Ruchi Bathia who has published it at (kaggle.com)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney], and has been lightly cleaned for use in this project.
